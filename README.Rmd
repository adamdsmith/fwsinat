# Installing `fwsinat`

The `fwsinat` package requires you to have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (>= 3.3) installed on your computer as well as [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  Both will require administrative priveleges but the installation of packages after this initial install will not.

With R and Rtools installed, it's simple to install and load the `fwsinat` package to access its functionality. If you receive an SSL or CA Certificate error, you may need to take the extra step documented below.  

```
# If devtools package is not installed
install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)

# Now install and load fwsinat
devtools::install_github("adamdsmith/fwsinat")
library("fwsinat")

# If you receive a SSL or CA Certificate error
install.packages("httr")
library("httr")
set_config(config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))
devtools::install_github("adamdsmith/fwsinat")
library("fwsinat")
```

# The `fwsinat` package

This packages currently contains functions to:

1.  download iNaturalist observations for any number of iNaturalist projects (`retrieve_inat`);
2.  (optionally) assign those observation to the USFWS property in which they occur (`assign_inat`); 
3.  update previously retrieved observations from iNaturalist projects (`update`); and
4.  export the observations to separate spreadsheets by USFWS property for distribution (`export_inat`);

# Using `fwsinat`

First, lets specify some iNaturalist projects (sometimes called 'slugs') from which to retrieve data...

```{r}
slugs <- c("bon-secour-national-wildlife-refuge-bioblitz",
           "2012-bioblitz-at-don-edwards-san-francisco-bay-national-wildlife-refuge",
           "antioch-dunes-national-wildlife-refuge-bioblitz")
```

Now let's retrieve the observations from iNaturalist...

```{r, cache=TRUE}
ex <- retrieve_inat(slugs)
```

and assign them to a refuge based on their geographic location...  

Some (occasionally many) observations may not fall within a USFWS property boundary because the location information is obscured, either by the user or by [iNaturalist (for IUCN Red List 'near-threatened' and higher risk)](http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/help#obscured).  These we assume (perhaps incorrectly?) belong to the nearest USFWS property. Other observations falling outside property boundaries and *not* indicated to have obscured coordinates are dropped.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
ex <- assign_inat(ex, progress = FALSE)
```

This object contains observations for potentially many refuges.  We want to distribute these observations to USFWS property-specific spreadsheets for distribution to those properties.  First, we create a list of properties with observations and then loop through them...

```{r}
orgs <- unique(ex$orgname)
for (org in orgs) {
  tmp_ex <- dplyr::filter(ex, orgname == org)
  export_inat(tmp_ex, dir = "./Output", xl_out = org)
}
```
