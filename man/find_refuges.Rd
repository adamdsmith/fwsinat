\usage{
find_refuges(refuge = NULL, ptype = c("NWR", "NFH", "WMD", "WMA", "WPA"),
  region = 1:8L)
}
\arguments{
\item{refuge}{character string scalar or vector (i.e., multiple entries allowed and
regular expressions allowed) with which to search and return valid refuge or hatchery
identifiers for use with \code{\link{inat_retrieve}}. Default (`NULL`) returns all
available National Wildlife Refuges (see \code{ptype} argument.  Case-insensitive
search. Regular expressions allowed. See Examples.}

\item{ptype}{character string scalar or vector of types of USFWS properties to search.
Default is to search all property types.  Other viable options include National Wildlife
Refuges only \code{ptype} = "NWR", "NFH" (National Fish Hatchery; southeast region only
at the moment), "WMD" (Wetland Managment District), "WMA" (Wildlife Management Area),
and WPA" (Waterfowl Production Area).  Any combination of options is permissible.}

\item{region}{integer vector indicating which USFWS Region to search; see
\url{https://www.fws.gov/where}; valid values range from 1 to 8}
}
\value{
character scalar or vector of proper organizational name (ORGNAME) for USFWS
 properties meeting the search criteria.  This output can be passed directly as the
 \code{refuge} argument in \code{\link{inat_retrieve}}.

# Search for refuges using a partial name match
